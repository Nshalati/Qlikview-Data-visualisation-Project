# Qlikview-Data-visualisation-Project
My dataset is about the commuting times of employed and unemployed users from all nine provinces in south Africa. It outlines and lists people that walk to work, drive to work and commuters who work in either formal sector or informal sector.I used Qlikview to do my data analysis and print the final output.
